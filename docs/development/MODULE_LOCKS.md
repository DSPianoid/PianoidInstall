Active file locks held by dev agents. A locked file must not be edited by another agent until released.

Locks are released after: commit (wrap-up), revert (reset), or commit/stash (pause). Never edit another agent's lock entries.

     Fix for 5-min hardcoded polling timeout in

     Fix for 5000 ms axios timeout on measurement-set deletion.

     handler was correct). 18/18 useMeasurementCatalog tests PASS;
     78/78 broader measurement-related Jest sweep PASS. Held files
     were the 4 candidates investigated; only 2 (useMeasurementCatalog
     .js + its Jest test) ended up edited. NOT merged to dev yet -
     awaits user verification (live browser test of delete from
     Measurements Management dialog). -->
